# Sybil-Dashboard

“Sybil defense and grant reviewing procedures currently managed by humans to be broken down into discrete units, defined in code, documented and made accessible as composable building blocks. These are known as “Legos”. Lego bricks are simple building blocks that can be connected to each other in creative combinations to form all kinds of structures or even machines that are much more complex than their component parts. Similarly, modular, composable software tools can be used to build imaginative systems for defending against Sybils.” [from Gitcoin forum, What does a Lego look like?](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/anti-sybil-legos/12265)
